### Retrieve a list of students who can receive a given notification.

A `notification` consists of:

- the teacher who is sending the notification, and
- the text of the notification itself.

To receive notifications from e.g. 'teacherken@gmail.com', a student:

- MUST NOT be suspended,
- AND MUST fulfill _AT LEAST ONE_ of the following:
  1. is registered with â€œteacherken@gmail.com"
  2. has been @mentioned in the notification

The list of students retrieved should not contain any duplicates/repetitions.

- Endpoint: `POST /api/retrievefornotifications`
- Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
- Success response status: HTTP 200 OK
- Request body example:

```
{
  "teacher":  "teacherken@gmail.com",
  "notification": "Hello students! @studentagnes@gmail.com @studentmiche@gmail.com"
}
```

- Success response body:

```
{
  "recipients":
    [
      "studentbob@gmail.com",
      "studentagnes@gmail.com",
      "studentmiche@gmail.com"
    ]
}
```

In the example above, `studentagnes@gmail.com` and `studentmiche@gmail.com` can receive the notification from `teacherken@gmail.com`, regardless whether they are registered to him, because they are `@mentioned` in the notification text. `studentbob@gmail.com` however, has to be registered to `teacherken@gmail.com`.

- Request body example:

```
{
  "teacher":  "teacherken@gmail.com",
  "notification": "Hey everybody"
}
```

- Success response body:

```
{
  "recipients":
    [
      "studentbob@gmail.com"
    ]
}
```
